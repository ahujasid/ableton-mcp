# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** An AI assistant can produce actual music in Ableton — instruments load, notes play, effects shape sound, and the mix comes together.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation Repair

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Foundation Repair)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-13 — Completed Plan 01-01 Python 3 cleanup

Progress: [▓░░░░░░░░░] 3%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: 0.08 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation Repair | 1/3 | 5min | 5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5min)
- Trend: Starting

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Extend existing codebase rather than rebuild — architecture is sound
- [Roadmap]: Python 3 only, strip all Py2 compat — Ableton Live 12 = Python 3.11
- [Roadmap]: Fine granularity selected — 10 phases to let natural domain boundaries stand
- [01-01]: Used grep-based tests reading actual source files for cleanup verification
- [01-01]: Achieved zero .format() calls remaining (plan allowed up to 2)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Instrument loading fix requires same-callback selected_track + load_item + device count verification — race condition is documented, fix is known
- [Phase 9]: Automation envelopes require understanding Session vs Arrangement envelope distinction — may need research spike during Phase 9 planning
- [Phase 10]: Input/output routing APIs vary by track type and hardware — needs testing against actual Ableton instance before implementation
