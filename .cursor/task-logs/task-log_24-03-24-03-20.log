GOAL: Document the successful loading of instruments in Ableton Live through the MCP API
IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Initial attempts to load instruments from the Sounds browser failed
2. Attempts to load from specific sound categories also failed
3. The successful approach was to use native Ableton instruments
4. Current configuration:
   - Track 0 (Lo-Fi Drums): Drum Rack
   - Track 1 (Lo-Fi Keys): E-Piano Muted Pure (UltraAnalog)
   - Track 2 (Lo-Fi Bass): Analog
   - Track 3 (Lo-Fi Atmosphere): Wavetable

KEY LEARNING: When loading instruments, prefer using native Ableton devices from the Instruments category rather than browser presets.
